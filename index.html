    <h1 style="color:red;">Awesome Family Fun Activities</h1>
    <p>Hide and Seek: Depending on the size of your backyard, hide and seek is a great way for your kids to run and explore but within the safety of your own
home. This game becomes more challenging and interesting if you combine it with the indoors of your home. Depending on the age of your kids, you may need to s
et some guidelines or rules in place so that no one gets lost or hurt during the game.</p>

    <p>Gardening: Much like our indoor gardening ideas above, outdoor gardening is a classic fun family activity in which the whole family can bond and enjoy
together. There are many ways to approach family gardening, and we recommend starting out by taking your kids and family to the local gardening store, whether
 itâ€™s a nursery or a plant sale shop. </p>
